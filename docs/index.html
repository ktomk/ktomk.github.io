  <li> <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-travis-yml">Run
      .travis.yml Github Action</a> :: Run `.travis.yml` build jobs/scripts
      as a Github Action. Travis-CI is harshly reducing the options for what
      they call "Open Source Projects" while the .org and .com homepage
      still announces "Testing your open source projects will always be
      free!" but many, many projects report they don't offer any
      practical options for them any longer. No complaints here, this Github
      Action allows to bring build times on Travis-CI down quickly and to
      migrate those build jobs easily of which Microsofts Github is able to
      run. Diversify and maintain flexibility.

  <li> <a href="./writing/yaml-anchor-alias-and-merge-key.html">YAML Anchor,
      Aliases and Merge Keys</a> :: Reference to a subset of YAML,
      specifically to alias/anchor references and to do mixins.

  <li> <a href="./pipelines/index.html">Pipelines - Run Bitbucket Pipelines
      Wherever They Dock</a> :: The <tt>pipelines</tt> utility runs
      pipelines by the <tt>bitbucket-pipelines.yml</tt> file-format, a
      portable, project centric way for a complete Docker container based
      (local) build.
